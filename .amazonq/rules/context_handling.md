# Context Handling Rules

## Document Reading (MANDATORY)
- When a document is referenced with @, read it COMPLETELY before proceeding
- Do NOT skim or summarize referenced documents
- STOP and re-read if you find yourself making assumptions not explicitly stated in the document
- If a document contains numbered steps or rules, enumerate them back before proceeding

## Acknowledgment Required
- After reading any @ referenced document, confirm understanding by listing key rules or steps
- Do NOT proceed with any task until you have demonstrated comprehension of referenced materials
